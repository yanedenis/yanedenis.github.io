        <p class="main-description">The Nissan Silvia (Japanese: 日産・シルビア, Hepburn: Nissan Shirubia) is the series of small sports cars produced
            by Nissan. Versions of the Silvia have been marketed as the 200SX or 240SX for export, with some export
            versions being sold under the Datsun brand.</p>

                    <p class="card-info">The S13 Silvia was introduced in mid-1988. Upon its introduction in Japan, it became immensely popular in that region and won the 1988 Car of the Year Japan Award. Nissan replaced the Gazelle with the 180SX, which served as the junior companion to the Fairlady ZX at Nissan Bluebird Store Japanese dealerships. As before, the Silvia was exclusive to Japanese dealerships called Nissan Prince Store next to the Skyline.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <p class="card-info">The S14 Silvia debuted in Japan towards the end of 1993. It was lower and wider than the S13. New rounded styling contributed to the illusion of a greater increase in size than actually occurred. Wheelbase and track were both increased, leading to slightly improved handling. Unlike export markets, where sales of the S14 chassis variants faltered, the Silvia remained popular in Japan. However, the width dimension exceeded 1,700 mm (67 in), which pushed this generation out of the compact class tax bracket and made Japanese buyers liable for higher road taxes. Sales of the S14 also faltered because specialty car buyers at the time were moving to RVs and SUVs. The fastback and convertible bodystyles were discontinued internationally, leaving only the coupé in production.</p>

                    <p class="card-info">In January 1999, Japan saw a new version of the Silvia, the S15, now producing 250 PS (247 bhp; 184 kW) at 6,400 rpm and 275 N⋅m; 203 lbf⋅ft (28 kg⋅m) of torque at 4,800 rpm from its SR20DET inline-four engine, thanks to a ball bearing turbocharger upgrade, as well as an improved engine management system. The non-turbo SR20DE produces 165 PS (163 bhp; 121 kW). This generation of the Silvia was only sold new in Japan, Indonesia, Australia and New Zealand, with the latter two being sold as the Nissan 200SX with various differences between the two markets.</p>
